# Contributing to Postleaf

Postleaf is a simple, beautiful, decentralized publishing platform that anyone can use. It's free, open source, and built for the modern publisher.

I'm building Postleaf for the greater good. I want everyone to have a chance to participate in its development no matter their skill level, and nobody should feel out of place for asking a question, submitting their code, etc.

That said, I have a few simple rules I'm asking everyone to follow:

- Don't be mean.
- Don't be a troll.
- Don't be a keyboard warrior.

People from all over the world participate here, and everyone is welcome. Please bear in mind that not all people share the same languages, skills, and beliefs as you. Many are here to learn, so please facilitate that.

## Support

Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Instead, visit postleaf.org/support for support.

## Bug Reports

Bugs should be submitted to the issue tracker. Before creating a new issue, please search open and closed issues to make sure it hasn't already been addressed.

For bug reports, please provide:

- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the bug.
- A minimal test case to demonstrate the bug (if applicable).
- Postleaf version, Node version, etc.

A good bug report will show us how to reproduce the problem quickly. A not-so-good bug report is likely to sit around waiting for additional feedback before anything can get fixed.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests may be submitted to the issue tracker as well. Before creating a new issue, please search open and close issues to make sure it hasn't already been requested.

To vote for a specific feature, use GitHub reactions to üëç or üëé. Remember that you can watch an issue to receive notifications anytime somebody comments.

## Pull Requests

I welcome design and code contributions, but bear in mind that I'm very opinionated. I've spent a lot of time and effort working on Postleaf, and I've developed a very clear vision for this project.

Before embarking on a large, complex, or controversial feature, please open an issue so we can discuss it. Someone may be working on it already, it might not align with Postleaf's roadmap, or we might be able to improve on your idea before you spend time working on it.

If your PR doesn't get accepted, don't let it get you down. Many don't. It doesn't mean I don't value your idea or contribution, it just means that it doesn't align with my vision for the project. As the maintainer, I'll do my best to explain why every PR doesn't get accepted.

### Code Quality

Postleaf uses an `.editorconfig` file to enforce things like indentation, trailing whitespace, etc. Please make sure your editor supports [EditorConfig]((http://editorconfig.org/)) before submitting a PR.

I'm quite picky about code quality. That doesn't mean I don't like your code, it means I prefer the code to stay consistent. If you follow the same conventions as the rest of the project's code, you'll be good to go.

### Linting

I recommend using [Atom](https://atom.io/) because it has [a great linter plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-lint). If you use this along with [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint) you'll save yourself a lot of time during development. While you're at it, don't forget to grab the [.editorconfig](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig) plugin.

This is by no means mandatory, but it will save you a lot of time. If your preferred IDE doesn't support linting, you can also see ESLint errors while running `gulp watch`.
