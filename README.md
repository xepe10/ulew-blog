## Documentation

Detailed instructions for installing, updating, and creating themes can be found at [postleaf.org/docs](https://www.postleaf.org/docs).

## Installation for Developers

This guide assumes you're installing Postleaf locally for development purposes. Please make sure the following dependencies are installed on your system before continuing:

- Node 7 (lower versions have not been tested and are not supported)
- npm
- Git
- SQLite 3
- GraphicsMagick

**You will also need access to an SMTP server for sending emails.** Otherwise, you won't be able to create users, perform password resets, etc. If you don't already have a transactional email service, the folks over at Discourse have put together a great [list of email providers](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-email.md) ‚Äî many of which offer free plans.

To install Postleaf in a development environment, follow these instructions.

1. Open a terminal and clone the project and default theme:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Postleaf/postleaf.git
  git clone https://github.com/Postleaf/empower-theme.git themes/empower-theme
  ```
2. Make a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`. Open it and change `AUTH_SECRET` to a random string to secure your app. Then add your SMTP credentials so email can be sent. You also need to set the `APP_URL` to `http://localhost:3000/`.
3. Install dependencies and run the build script:
  ```
  npm install
  sudo npm install -g gulp-cli
  gulp build
  ```
4. Now launch the app:
  ```
  node app.js
  ```

At this point, you should be able to see Postleaf running by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Themes

To install a theme, simply add it to the `themes` directory. There are a few additional themes located in the [main repo](https://github.com/Postleaf).

To learn how to create your own theme, refer to the [theme documentation](https://www.postleaf.org/themes-overview).
